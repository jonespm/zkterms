This is a sample CM_ACADEMIC_SESSION_T editor for Sakai terms.

I wrote this long ago and converted it to the latest ZK archetype and it looks like it still works! There is currently no security protecting this so that's the biggest problem. (It promotes itself to admin) 

So do not use this for production or use this really yet. I just wanted to save a copy of it.
